This folder contains three subfolders with the raw data used for my thesis:

- Sea Surface Temperature
- Thermocline Depth
- Wind Stress

The folders are here to show the structure, but the actual data is not included because the files are too large.

What is inside each foler and what you need to download:

1. Sea Surface Temperature 
   - Monthly gridded SST data.
   - Download from this link: https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/fileServer/Datasets/noaa.ersst.v5/sst.mnmean.nc
   - You need to download the **NetCDF monthly data** 
   - Place the `.nc` files in the folder `Sea Surface Temperature/`

2. Thermocline Depth
   - This folder contains the subsurface ocean temperature data used to calculate the 20Â°C isotherm depth (z20).
   - Download all NetCDF files for the period 1940 to 2023
   - Keep the downloaded `.zip` file and place .zip files into `Thermocline Depth/`
   - Download this: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/en4/EN.4.2.2.analyses.g10.download-list.txt (but only from 1940 to 2023)

3. Wind Stress:
   - Monthly averaged zonal and meridional wind stress data
   - Download from: https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/fileServer/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis/Monthlies/surface_gauss/uflx.sfc.mon.mean.nc
   - Variable to download; 'uflx'
   - Place it inside `Wind Stress/`
